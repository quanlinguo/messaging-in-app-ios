# Frequently Asked Questions

## Should I build a POC first to validate the native SDK solves my connectivity issues?

**Question:** Before committing to building a custom native app and migrating all users, should I first validate that the native SDK actually solves our intermittent connectivity issues?

**Answer:** **YES, absolutely!** This is the correct risk management approach.

### Why POC First?

Before committing to a 3-4 month development effort to build a custom native app (based on UIKitMIAW.swift), you should validate your hypothesis:

**Hypothesis to Test:**
> "The native Messaging SDK solves our intermittent connectivity and session loss issues better than the web-based approach."

**If native SDK DOESN'T solve the problem** → Don't build the custom app
**If native SDK DOES solve the problem** → You have a clear business case to proceed

### Quick POC Validation (2-4 Weeks)

#### Week 1: Setup & Initial Testing

**Minimal Configuration Steps:**

1. **Open the sample project**
   ```bash
   cd messaging-in-app-ios
   open MessagingExample.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Configure UIKitMIAW.swift**
   - File: `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift`
   - Line 69: Replace demo URL with your Experience Cloud URL
   - Example: `guard let url = URL(string: "https://your-experience-cloud.force.com") else { ... }`

3. **Configure Salesforce credentials**
   - File: `examples/MessagingUIExample/configFile.json`
   ```json
   {
       "OrganizationId": "YOUR_ORG_ID",
       "DeveloperName": "YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME",
       "Url": "https://YOUR_ORG.salesforce-scrt.com"
   }
   ```

4. **Set Passthrough authentication**
   - Run app in simulator
   - Open Settings menu
   - Set "Authorization Method" to "Passthrough"
   - Login with Salesforce credentials

5. **Document current web behavior**
   - Test same scenarios in your mobile publisher app
   - Document exactly what happens during network issues
   - Establish baseline for comparison

#### Week 2: Network Resilience Testing

**Critical Test Scenarios:**

| Scenario | How to Test | Expected (Native) | Current (Web) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Network drop during chat** | Enable Airplane mode mid-conversation | Session persists, messages queue | Session lost? |
| **Network reconnection** | Disable Airplane mode | Queued messages send, conversation continues | New session? |
| **App force quit** | Force quit app, reopen | Same conversation loads | Session lost? |
| **App background** | Background 5+ minutes, then foreground | Conversation intact | Timeout? |
| **Weak connectivity** | Network Link Conditioner: 3G/Edge | Handles gracefully | Errors/timeouts? |
| **Complete offline** | Turn off WiFi and cellular | Clear offline state, auto-retry | Unclear state? |

**Testing Tools:**
- **Airplane mode** - Quick on/off network testing
- **Network Link Conditioner** - Xcode → Settings → Network Link Conditioner
  - Simulates: 3G, Edge, Very Bad Network, 100% Loss
- **Charles Proxy** - Monitor network traffic and latency
- **Xcode Console** - Watch for reconnection logs in SMIClientCore

**What to Monitor:**
```
Settings → Logging → Enable Core Logging
Settings → Logging → Enable UI Logging

// Watch for in console:
- "SSE connection established"
- "SSE connection lost"
- "Reconnecting..."
- ConversationUUID persistence
```

#### Week 3: Measure Success Criteria

**Critical Metrics:**

✅ **Session Persistence**
- [ ] Conversation UUID persists across network drops
- [ ] Messages stay in history after reconnection
- [ ] Users can resume conversations after app restart
- [ ] Same conversation continues after force quit

✅ **Message Delivery**
- [ ] Messages sent during connectivity loss deliver when network returns
- [ ] No duplicate messages
- [ ] Message order preserved
- [ ] Typing indicators work correctly

✅ **User Experience**
- [ ] Connection status clearly visible (MessagingSessionWidget)
- [ ] Error messages helpful and actionable
- [ ] Reconnection happens automatically
- [ ] No crashes or freezes during network transitions

✅ **Performance**
- [ ] Reconnection time < 5 seconds
- [ ] App handles poor network gracefully
- [ ] UI remains responsive during reconnection
- [ ] Battery impact acceptable

**Quantify the Improvement:**
- Current web app: X% of sessions lost during network issues
- Native SDK: Y% of sessions persisted
- **Is the improvement significant enough to justify the investment?**

#### Week 4: User Validation (Highly Recommended)

**Real-World Testing:**

1. **Identify test users**
   - 5-10 users who currently experience connectivity issues
   - Mix of network conditions (WiFi, cellular, poor coverage areas)

2. **Deploy TestFlight build**
   - Build UIKitMIAW.swift POC
   - Distribute via TestFlight
   - Provide clear testing instructions

3. **Gather feedback**
   - Survey questions:
     - "Did you experience session loss?"
     - "Did messages deliver reliably?"
     - "How was the reconnection experience?"
     - "Is this better than the current app?"

4. **Measure actual improvement**
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Reported session loss incidents
   - Message delivery failures
   - Support ticket reduction

### Decision Gates After POC

#### ✅ If Native SDK Solves the Problem

**You Have Proof:**
- Native SDK handles connectivity measurably better
- Users confirm improved experience
- Session persistence works as expected
- Clear business case for custom app development

**Next Steps:**
1. Present POC results to stakeholders
2. Get approval for 3-4 month custom app development
3. Plan user migration strategy
4. Estimate full feature parity requirements (push notifications, etc.)
5. Begin full development based on UIKitMIAW.swift template

**Expected Timeline:**
- POC: 2-4 weeks (completed)
- Full Development: 3-4 months (from FAQ Option 1)
- **Total: ~4-5 months to production**

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Development cost: [X months of iOS developer time]
- User migration effort: [Communication, support, training]
- Ongoing maintenance: [Native app updates, App Store management]
- **vs.**
- Cost of current connectivity issues: [Support tickets, user churn, poor experience]

#### ❌ If Native SDK DOESN'T Solve the Problem

**Don't Proceed with Custom App** - building it won't solve your problem!

**Alternative Options:**

1. **Work with Salesforce**
   - Ask about mobile publisher improvements roadmap
   - Request enterprise support for connectivity issues
   - Explore other Salesforce solutions

2. **Improve web-based approach**
   - Implement service workers for offline support
   - Better session management in web chat
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) enhancements

3. **Hybrid partial solution**
   - Deploy separate messaging app for users with issues (FAQ Option 2)
   - Keep mobile publisher for majority of users
   - Gradually migrate only problem users

4. **Accept limitations**
   - If issue affects only small subset of users
   - If cost of solution exceeds cost of problem
   - Communicate limitations clearly to users

### POC Success Checklist

Before proceeding to full development, ensure:

- [ ] Native SDK demonstrably solves connectivity issues
- [ ] Improvement is quantified (X% to Y% session retention)
- [ ] Real users validate the improvement
- [ ] Business case is clear (ROI positive)
- [ ] Stakeholders approve full development
- [ ] Development team is committed (3-4 months)
- [ ] User migration plan is defined
- [ ] Feature parity requirements are documented
- [ ] Ongoing maintenance plan is in place

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Does native SDK solve the connectivity problem?** (Primary validation)
2. **By how much?** (Quantify: 10% improvement? 90% improvement?)
3. **What's the user impact?** (Real users confirm improvement)
4. **What's the development cost?** (Time, resources, opportunity cost)
5. **What's the migration impact?** (How many users, communication strategy)
6. **What about feature parity?** (Push notifications, offline data, analytics, etc.)
7. **What's the ROI?** (Development cost vs cost of connectivity issues)
8. **What are the risks?** (App Store approval, user adoption, ongoing maintenance)

### Why This Approach is Sound Risk Management

✅ **Minimizes wasted effort** - 2-4 weeks vs 3-4 months
✅ **Provides data for decisions** - Not guessing, validating
✅ **Validates assumptions** - Does native really solve the problem?
✅ **Creates working demo** - Show stakeholders actual solution
✅ **Identifies unforeseen issues** - Discover problems early
✅ **Builds confidence** - Team and stakeholders see proof
✅ **Enables informed go/no-go** - Clear decision criteria

### POC Deliverables

**At end of POC, you should have:**

1. **Working demo** - UIKitMIAW.swift configured for your org
2. **Test results** - Data from all network scenarios
3. **Comparison metrics** - Native vs web performance
4. **User feedback** - Real users validate improvement
5. **Decision document** - Go/no-go recommendation with justification

## What features from our mobile publisher app need to be replicated in the custom native app?

**Question:** Our target is a native mobile app that solves connectivity issues while retaining all current functionality of our mobile publisher app. Our users are busy, customer-facing professionals who rely on the app daily. What do we need to inventory and plan for?

**Answer:** Before committing to development, you must **explicitly inventory all mobile publisher features** to determine actual development scope and timeline. "Retain all functionality" can mean 3-4 months or 6-9 months depending on what your mobile publisher actually does.

### Why Feature Inventory is Critical

**UIKitMIAW.swift provides the foundation**, but mobile publisher apps often include features you may not consciously track:
- Push notifications
- Offline capabilities
- Custom navigation structures
- Analytics and monitoring
- Security features
- Preferences and settings

**The POC validates IF you should build it. The feature inventory determines HOW LONG it will take.**

### Step 2: Test Mobile Publisher Thoroughly

**Don't rely on documentation - actually test the app:**

**Scenario Testing:**
1. **Receive a notification**
   - What does it look like?
   - What happens when you tap it?
   - Where does it navigate?
   - Are there different notification types?

2. **Go completely offline**
   - What still works?
   - What shows error messages?
   - Is there cached content?
   - What happens when you go back online?

3. **Background the app for 24 hours**
   - Does it remember your state?
   - Does it refresh data?
   - Does it re-authenticate?

4. **Tap various links in Experience Cloud**
   - Do they open in-app?
   - Do they open in Safari?
   - Is there a consistent pattern?

5. **Try to download/upload a file**
   - Does it work?
   - Where are files saved?
   - What file types are supported?

6. **Check all settings/preferences**
   - What is configurable?
   - What is persisted?
   - Are there hidden features?

### Step 3: What UIKitMIAW.swift Provides vs What You Must Add

**✅ Already Included in UIKitMIAW.swift:**
- WKWebView for Experience Cloud content
- Native messaging with session persistence
- Salesforce OAuth via Mobile SDK (Passthrough authentication)
- Basic navigation structure
- Conversation management
- Network state handling
- Conversation UUID persistence

**❌ NOT Included (You Must Implement):**

**High Priority (Most Apps Need These):**
- Push notifications infrastructure
- Deep linking from notifications
- Custom navigation structure (tabs, menus)
- App branding (splash screen, icons)
- User preferences/settings UI
- Analytics integration
- Error tracking/monitoring

**Medium Priority (Depends on Your App):**
- Offline data handling (beyond messaging)
- Advanced security features
- Multi-tab or complex navigation
- File download/upload handling
- Custom Experience Cloud integrations

**Lower Priority (Nice to Have):**
- Advanced offline sync
- Feature flags/A-B testing
- Sophisticated monitoring
- Internationalization (if not needed initially)

### Step 4: Prioritize Features for MVP

Create a feature matrix:

| Feature | Description | Priority | Complexity | Est. Effort | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Experience Cloud view | Display site in WKWebView | Must-have | Low | ✅ Included | UIKitMIAW.swift |
| Native messaging | Chat with session persistence | Must-have | Low | ✅ Included | UIKitMIAW.swift |
| Salesforce auth | OAuth login | Must-have | Low | ✅ Included | Mobile SDK |
| Push notifications | Notify on new messages | Must-have | Medium | 2-3 weeks | APNs integration |
| Deep linking | Notification → conversation | Must-have | Medium | 1-2 weeks | URL handling |
| Navigation structure | Match current tab bar | Must-have | Medium | 1-2 weeks | UITabBarController |
| App branding | Icons, splash screen | Must-have | Low | 1 week | Asset creation |
| Settings screen | User preferences | Should-have | Low | 1 week | SwiftUI form |
| Analytics | Track usage | Should-have | Medium | 1-2 weeks | SDK integration |
| Offline content | Cache web pages | Nice-to-have | High | 3-4 weeks | Complex sync |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Priority Definitions:**
- **Must-have** - App is unusable or unacceptable without this feature
- **Should-have** - Users will complain if missing, but app is usable
- **Nice-to-have** - Enhancement that can wait for v2

### Step 5: Validate with Users

**Interview Your Actual Users:**

Questions to ask busy, customer-facing professionals:
1. "What do you use the mobile app for on a daily basis?"
2. "What features would make the app unusable if they were missing?"
3. "What happens when you're offline? What still needs to work?"
4. "Do you rely on push notifications? For what scenarios?"
5. "What makes you most productive in the current app?"
6. "What frustrates you about the current app?"
7. "If you had to choose 3 features to keep, what would they be?"

**This tells you what REALLY matters vs theoretical requirements.**

### Development Timeline Based on Feature Complexity

The original "3-4 months" estimate assumes **basic feature parity**. Actual timelines:

#### Minimal Feature Parity (3-4 months)
**Includes:**
- UIKitMIAW.swift foundation

### Feature Parity Checklist

Before committing to development timeline:

- [ ] Complete feature inventory of mobile publisher app
- [ ] Test every feature in current app
- [ ] Interview users about feature priorities
- [ ] Categorize features: Must-have, Should-have, Nice-to-have
- [ ] Estimate development effort for each feature
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval on MVP scope
- [ ] Confirm team has capacity for estimated timeline
- [ ] Budget accounts for actual feature complexity
- [ ] Migration plan accounts for feature changes
- [ ] Training plan for any UX differences

### Red Flags: Features That Significantly Increase Complexity

⚠️ **These features can add months to development:**

1. **Complex offline data sync** - Can double development time
2. **Multiple web views with shared state** - Complex state management
3. **Advanced security requirements** (HIPAA, SOC2) - Extensive compliance work
4. **Custom native features** beyond messaging - Each is mini-project
5. **Extensive third-party integrations** - Each SDK adds complexity
6. **Legacy compatibility** with old app versions - Migration complexity

If your mobile publisher has multiple red flags, consider:
- Phased approach (MVP with core features, then iterations)
- Reduced scope for v1.0
- Longer timeline (9-12 months)
- Additional development resources

### Bottom Line

**For your target: "Native app that solves connectivity while retaining all current functionality"**

✅ **Correct goal** - This is what users need
⚠️ **"All current functionality" must be explicitly defined** - Determines 4-9 month timeline
📋 **Feature inventory is not optional** - Required for accurate planning
💰 **Budget should reflect actual complexity** - Not just basic UIKitMIAW.swift

**Action Items:**
1. **During POC** (Weeks 1-4): Validate connectivity solution
2. **Before development** (Weeks 5-6): Complete feature inventory
3. **Planning phase** (Weeks 7-8): Finalize MVP scope and timeline
4. **Development** (4-6 months): Build with realistic expectations
5. **Migration** (1-2 months): Transition users with proper support

**The POC proves it works. The feature inventory proves it's feasible within your constraints.**

## Which sample app should I use for handling intermittent network connectivity?

**Question:** I have a mobile publisher app for advanced messaging. Users experience intermittent network connectivity issues. When connectivity is lost, active sessions are dropped, leading to a poor user experience. Even when connectivity is restored, user sessions are lost. Salesforce suggested building a native app using the provided sample code to address these connectivity issues. Which sample app is most appropriate?

**Answer:** Use **MessagingUIExample** as your starting point.

### Why MessagingUIExample is Better for Network Reliability

#### 1. Built-in Conversation Persistence

MessagingUIExample implements conversation UUID persistence through `ConversationManagementStore`. This is critical for maintaining sessions across network interruptions:

```swift
// From examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/ContentView.swift:49
conversationId: conversationManagementStore.conversationUUID
```

The UUID is persisted to UserDefaults, ensuring the same conversation continues when connectivity is restored, even after app restarts.

#### 2. Session Status Visibility

The UI SDK includes `MessagingSessionWidget` (v1.9.0+) that displays:
- Connection/session status
- Queue position
- Agent name with unread message counter

This provides users with visual feedback during connectivity issues, significantly improving the experience during intermittent network conditions.

**Location:** `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/MessagingSessionWidget.swift`

#### 3. Automatic Reconnection Handling

The UI SDK (SMIClientUI) is built on top of the Core SDK and handles reconnection scenarios more gracefully out of the box. The underlying `CoreClient.start()` manages the SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection and automatic reconnection without additional implementation.

#### 4. Network State Monitoring

The example uses `GlobalCoreDelegateHandler` which implements `CoreDelegate` and receives network connectivity callbacks:

```swift
// CoreDelegate protocol method
func coreClient(_ core: CoreClient,
                didChangeNetworkState state: NetworkConnectivityState)
```

This allows you to display appropriate UI feedback during network issues.

**Location:** `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler.swift`

#### 5. Reduced Implementation Risk

Since Salesforce recommended using the sample code specifically to address connectivity issues, MessagingUIExample already demonstrates best practices for:
- Delegate registration timing (critical for proper event handling)
- Configuration management
- Session continuity
- Network state handling

### Key Implementation Points

When using MessagingUIExample as your base:

1. **Preserve conversation UUID management** - Keep the `ConversationManagementStore` pattern as-is to ensure sessions persist
2. **Enable session status widget** - Configure `MessagingSessionWidget` to show connection status to users
3. **Monitor CoreDelegate callbacks** - Customize `GlobalCoreDelegateHandler.swift` to handle network state changes appropriately for your UX
4. **Test reconnection scenarios** - Verify messages are properly queued and sent when connectivity returns

### When to Use MessagingCoreExample Instead

Only use MessagingCoreExample if you need:
- Complete custom UI that's drastically different from the provided interface
- Fine-grained control over message queuing and retry logic
- Custom network handling beyond what the SDK provides
- To build your own session persistence mechanism

However, for the specific problem of sessions being dropped during intermittent connectivity, the UI SDK was designed to handle this scenario, making **MessagingUIExample the recommended choice**.

### Additional Resources

- See `CLAUDE.md` for complete architecture documentation
- Core SDK reference: `examples/MessagingCoreExample/Models/MessagingViewModel.swift`
- UI SDK reference: `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/ContentView.swift`
- Network state handling: `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler.swift`

## What is the relationship between the Messaging SDK and Salesforce Mobile SDK?

**Question:** When building Salesforce mobile apps, I've always used the Salesforce Mobile SDK. When I look at this sample code, I'm unclear whether it uses the Salesforce Mobile SDK, is built on top of it, or represents a different approach altogether.

**Answer:** The **Messaging for In-App SDK is a completely separate, standalone SDK** that does NOT require the Salesforce Mobile SDK to function. However, the Salesforce Mobile SDK can be used OPTIONALLY for one specific authentication method.

### The Two SDKs Are Independent

#### Messaging for In-App SDK (This Repository)
- **Package**: `Swift-Package-InAppMessaging` from `https://github.com/Salesforce-Async-Messaging/Swift-Package-InAppMessaging.git`
- **Frameworks**: `SMIClientCore` and `SMIClientUI`
- **Purpose**: Messaging/chat functionality for customer support
- **Operates independently**: Does NOT require Salesforce Mobile SDK
- **Can be used in**: Any iOS app, not just Salesforce-integrated apps

#### Salesforce Mobile SDK (Optional Dependency)
- **Package**: `SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM` from `https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM`
- **Frameworks**: `SalesforceSDKCore`, `MobileSync`, `SalesforceAnalytics`
- **Purpose**: Salesforce platform integration, OAuth authentication, data sync
- **Used for**: Passthrough authentication only (in these examples)

### Three Authentication Methods

The Messaging SDK supports three authentication approaches:

**Location:** `examples/Shared/Enums/AuthorizationMethod.swift`

1. **Unverified** - No authentication
   - Simplest approach
   - No user identity verification
   - **Use case:** Public messaging, anonymous support
   - ✅ **No Salesforce Mobile SDK required**

2. **User Verified (JWT)** - Your app provides a JWT token
   - You implement JWT generation in your backend
   - Pass token via `UserVerificationDelegate`
   - **Use case:** Users with non-Salesforce accounts (your own auth system)
   - **Example:** Retail app where customers have company accounts, not Salesforce credentials
   - ✅ **No Salesforce Mobile SDK required**
   - **Location:** `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:18-19`

3. **Passthrough** - Uses Salesforce Mobile SDK for authentication
   - Leverages Salesforce Mobile SDK OAuth login
   - Automatically retrieves JWT token from Salesforce
   - **Use case:** Users with Salesforce credentials (including Experience Cloud users)
   - **Example:** Experience Cloud site users who log in with Salesforce credentials
   - ❌ **Requires Salesforce Mobile SDK**
   - **Location:** `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:21-23`
   - **Implementation:** Lines 32-45 use `AuthHelper.loginIfRequired` from SalesforceSDKCore

### IMPORTANT: For Experience Cloud Users

**If your users are Experience Cloud users who authenticate with Salesforce credentials, you MUST use Passthrough authentication, which means you NEED both SDKs:**

- ✅ **Messaging SDK** (SMIClientCore/UI) - For messaging functionality
- ✅ **Salesforce Mobile SDK** (SalesforceSDKCore) - For authentication

**Why:**
- Your users have **Salesforce Experience Cloud accounts**
- They authenticate using **Salesforce OAuth** (same credentials as your Experience Cloud site)
- Passthrough authentication provides single sign-on experience
- Mobile SDK handles Salesforce OAuth properly

**Configuration for Experience Cloud:**
```swift
import SMIClientCore
import SMIClientUI
import SalesforceSDKCore  // Required for Experience Cloud users

let config = Configuration(...)
config.userVerificationRequired = true  // Enable authentication

// Set authorization method to Passthrough
authorizationMethod = .passthrough

// UserVerificationDelegate will use Mobile SDK's AuthHelper
// See: GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:21-23
```

### How Passthrough Authentication Works (When Mobile SDK IS Used)

**File:** `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift`

```swift
// Line 22-23: Passthrough method
case .passthrough:
    await Self.salesforceLogin()  // Uses Salesforce Mobile SDK
    return await Self.fetchMIAWJWT(core)

// Lines 38-44: Calls Salesforce Mobile SDK login
AuthHelper.loginIfRequired {
    // User authenticated via Salesforce OAuth
}

// Lines 47-70: Fetches messaging JWT using Salesforce credentials
let request = RestRequest(method: .GET,
                         path: core.salesforceAuthenticationRequestPath)
```

**Passthrough flow:**
1. User logs into Salesforce using Mobile SDK OAuth (standard Salesforce login screen)
2. App uses Salesforce session to call messaging authentication endpoint
3. Salesforce returns messaging-specific JWT token
4. Messaging SDK uses that JWT for conversations

```
Dependencies:
├── SMIClientCore (required)
├── SMIClientUI (required)
└── SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM (optional - only for Passthrough auth)
    ├── SalesforceSDKCore
    ├── MobileSync
    └── SalesforceAnalytics
```

### Key Architectural Insight

**The Messaging SDK is NOT built on top of Salesforce Mobile SDK.**

They are separate SDKs that can optionally work together:

```
Your App
├── Messaging SDK (SMIClientCore/UI) - STANDALONE
│   └── Works independently for messaging
└── Salesforce Mobile SDK (optional)
    └── Only used if you choose Passthrough authentication
```

### When Should You Use Each SDK?

| Scenario | Use Messaging SDK | Use Mobile SDK | Auth Method |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Experience Cloud users (Salesforce credentials)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (REQUIRED) | Passthrough |
| **App already uses Salesforce Mobile SDK** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Passthrough |
| **Users have Salesforce accounts** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (REQUIRED) | Passthrough |
| **Users have non-Salesforce accounts (your own auth)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Not needed | JWT |
| **No user authentication needed** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Not needed | Unverified |
| **Need Salesforce data sync, offline, platform features** | Optional | ✅ Yes | Passthrough |

### Practical Examples

**Scenario 1: Experience Cloud Native App (REQUIRES BOTH SDKs)**
```swift
// Your users are Experience Cloud users with Salesforce credentials
import SMIClientUI
import SMIClientCore
import SalesforceSDKCore  // REQUIRED for Salesforce authentication

let config = Configuration(...)
config.userVerificationRequired = true  // Authentication required

// Use Passthrough authentication
authorizationMethod = .passthrough

// UserVerificationDelegate uses Mobile SDK's AuthHelper
// When user taps chat, they'll use Salesforce OAuth login
// Same credentials as they use for Experience Cloud site
// See: GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:21-23
```

**Scenario 2: Customer Service App with Non-Salesforce Users (NO Mobile SDK)**
```swift
// Your users have accounts in YOUR system, not Salesforce
// Example: Retail customers with company accounts
import SMIClientUI
import SMIClientCore
// NO SalesforceSDKCore import

let config = Configuration(...)
config.userVerificationRequired = true

// Implement UserVerificationDelegate to provide JWT
func core(_ core: CoreClient,
          userVerificationChallengeWith reason: ChallengeReason) async -> UserVerification? {

    // Call YOUR backend to generate JWT for this user
    let jwt = await YourBackend.generateMessagingJWT(customerId: currentUser.id)

    return UserVerification(customerIdentityToken: jwt, type: .JWT)
}
// See: GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:18-19
```

**Scenario 3: Anonymous Messaging (NO Mobile SDK)**
```swift
// Public messaging, no authentication
import SMIClientUI
import SMIClientCore

let config = Configuration(...)
config.userVerificationRequired = false  // Unverified mode

let uiConfig = UIConfiguration(configuration: config, ...)
Interface(uiConfig, ...)  // Works without Mobile SDK
```

### Bottom Line

- **Messaging SDK = Standalone messaging/chat SDK**
- **Salesforce Mobile SDK = Authentication SDK for Salesforce users**
- They are **separate products** that can optionally integrate
- **If your users have Salesforce credentials (including Experience Cloud):** You NEED both SDKs
- **If your users have non-Salesforce accounts (your own auth):** You only need Messaging SDK
- **If no authentication needed:** You only need Messaging SDK

### Decision Tree: Do I Need Mobile SDK?

```
Do your users log in with Salesforce credentials?
├─ YES (Experience Cloud, Salesforce users)
│  └─ ✅ Need BOTH: Messaging SDK + Mobile SDK (Passthrough auth)
│
└─ NO (Your own auth system, or no auth)
   └─ ✅ Need ONLY: Messaging SDK (JWT or Unverified)
```

This is different from Salesforce's traditional approach where mobile features required the Mobile SDK. The Messaging SDK is purpose-built for messaging and can work independently OR with Mobile SDK depending on your authentication requirements.

### For Your Experience Cloud + UIKitMIAW.swift App

Based on your scenario (Experience Cloud users with Salesforce credentials):

**Required Dependencies:**
```
Your Custom Native App (built from UIKitMIAW.swift)
├── SMIClientCore ✅ REQUIRED (messaging core)
├── SMIClientUI ✅ REQUIRED (messaging UI)
└── SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM ✅ REQUIRED (authentication)
    ├── SalesforceSDKCore (OAuth login)
    ├── MobileSync (optional - can exclude if not needed)
    └── SalesforceAnalytics (optional - can exclude if not needed)
```

**User Flow:**
1. User launches your custom app
2. **Salesforce Mobile SDK OAuth login** (SalesforceSDKCore)
   - User enters their Experience Cloud credentials
   - Same Salesforce login as web
3. App loads Experience Cloud site in WKWebView (UIKitMIAW.swift pattern)
4. Native chat button overlaid on web content
5. User taps chat → Messaging SDK launches
   - **Uses Passthrough authentication**
   - Messaging SDK leverages the Mobile SDK session
   - No second login required

**Implementation Reference:**
- Auth configuration: `examples/Shared/Enums/AuthorizationMethod.swift` → `.passthrough`
- Auth implementation: `examples/Shared/Delegates/CoreDelegate/GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift:21-45`
- UIKitMIAW pattern: `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift`

## How do I persist conversation sessions across app restarts?

The conversation UUID must be persisted to maintain session continuity:

```swift
// BAD: New UUID each time = new conversation
let conversationID = UUID()

// GOOD: Persisted UUID = continuous conversation
let conversationID = UserDefaults.standard.getConversationUUID() ?? UUID()
UserDefaults.standard.saveConversationUUID(conversationID)
```

MessagingUIExample already implements this pattern via `ConversationManagementStore`.

**Location:** `examples/Shared/Settings/Models/ConversationManagement.swift`

---

## Is the native SDK a standalone app? How does it work with our existing Experience Cloud mobile publisher app?

**Question:** Our existing mobile publisher app is for an Experience Cloud site (we have no source code for it). When I look at the recommended MessagingUIExample, is this intended to be a standalone native mobile app? If so, how would I replace our existing mobile publisher app with this approach while still supporting a full Experience Cloud site with an embedded chat button?

**Answer:** This is a critical architectural decision. Since your mobile publisher app is Salesforce-generated (no source code access), you **cannot integrate the native SDK into your existing app**. You have two distinct paths forward:

### Understanding Your Current Situation

#### Salesforce Mobile Publisher App (Current)
- **No source code access**: Generated by Salesforce Mobile Publisher
- **Web view wrapper**: Displays your Experience Cloud site in a mobile app shell
- **Embedded chat**: JavaScript-based chat widget within the web view
- **Session management**: Browser-based (cookies/localStorage)
- **Network handling**: Standard web browser networking
- **Cannot be modified**: No ability to add native SDK integration

#### Native SDK Approach (MessagingUIExample)
- **Custom native app**: Requires building from scratch
- **Full source code control**: You own and maintain the codebase
- **Native Swift/SwiftUI**: Direct SDK integration at native layer
- **Persistent sessions**: Conversation UUID in UserDefaults
- **Native networking**: SSE with built-in reconnection
- **Full customization**: Complete control over UX

### Your Two Options

#### Option 1: Build Custom Native App (Replace Mobile Publisher)

Build a completely new native iOS app that includes both Experience Cloud content and native messaging.

**Good News:** The repository includes `UIKitMIAW.swift` which demonstrates **exactly this pattern** - it's a working reference implementation.

```
New Custom Native App (based on UIKitMIAW.swift)
├── WKWebView displaying Experience Cloud site
├── Native floating button overlaid on web content
└── Native Messaging (SMIClientUI SDK) launched from button
```

##### How UIKitMIAW.swift Works (Your Starting Template)

**Location:** `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift`

This file demonstrates the complete hybrid architecture:

1. **Loads Experience Cloud in WKWebView** (lines 68-79):
   ```swift
   let webView = WKWebView()
   webView.load(URLRequest(url: url))
   view = webView
   ```
   Your users see the full Experience Cloud site with all branding and navigation.

2. **Overlays Native Chat Button** (lines 147-155):
   ```swift
   self.view.addSubview(floatingButton)
   // Positioned in bottom-right corner, above web content
   ```
   A native iOS button sits on top of the web view, always accessible.

3. **Launches Native Messaging** (lines 162-196):
   ```swift
   private func openChatFeed() {
       let controller = ModalInterfaceViewController(uiConfiguration, ...)
       self.present(controller, animated: true)
   }
   ```
   Tapping the button opens the full native messaging interface.

4. **Persists Conversation UUID** (line 54):
   ```swift
   conversationId: conversationManagementStore.conversationUUID
   ```
   Sessions survive network drops and app restarts.

##### Implementation Steps

**Phase 1: Basic Adaptation (1-2 weeks)**
1. Copy `UIKitMIAW.swift` as your starting point
2. Replace `demoManagementStore.demoDomain` (line 69) with your Experience Cloud URL
3. Configure `uiConfiguration` with your Salesforce org credentials
4. Update floating button branding/position as needed
5. Test basic flow: web content loads, native chat launches

**Phase 2: Experience Cloud Integration (2-4 weeks)**
1. **Hide web-based chat button**: Update your Experience Cloud site CSS to hide the embedded messaging widget when viewed in-app
   - Use user agent detection or custom URL parameter
   - Example: `?mobile_app=true` → hide chat widget via JavaScript
2. **Handle deep links**: If users tap links in Experience Cloud, decide navigation behavior
3. **Share authentication**: Integrate Salesforce Mobile SDK for unified login (see line 62 for delegate setup)

**Phase 3: Feature Parity (4-8 weeks)**
1. Add push notifications for new messages
2. Implement mobile publisher features you rely on
3. Add native navigation chrome (if needed)
4. Testing and refinement

**Phase 4: Deployment (2-3 weeks)**
1. App Store submission
2. User migration communication
3. Gradual rollout

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Working reference implementation exists** (UIKitMIAW.swift)
- ✅ **Proven architecture** from Salesforce official samples
- ✅ **Native messaging solves connectivity issues**
- ✅ **Preserves full Experience Cloud functionality**
- ✅ **Complete control over mobile experience**
- ✅ **Conversation persistence works correctly**

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Still requires building custom native app** (can't modify mobile publisher)
- ❌ **Users must migrate** from old app to new app
- ❌ **Coordination needed**: Hide web chat button, add native button
- ❌ **Ongoing maintenance** of native iOS codebase
- ❌ **App Store submission** and approval process

**Development Effort:**
- ~3-4 months for full feature parity
- Requires iOS developers skilled in Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit
- Much faster than generic "build from scratch" because UIKitMIAW.swift provides the exact pattern

#### Option 2: Keep Mobile Publisher, Build Separate Messaging App

Deploy native messaging as a separate, lightweight app while keeping the mobile publisher app:

```
User's Device
├── Experience Cloud Mobile Publisher App (existing - unchanged)
│   └── Has embedded web chat
└── [YourCompany] Messaging App (new - standalone native messaging)
    └── For users with connectivity issues
```

**This means:**
- MessagingUIExample becomes a standalone "messaging-only" app
- Users experiencing connectivity issues can download this separate app
- Two apps on user's device (not ideal UX)
- Gradually migrate users from web chat to native messaging app

**Pros:**
- Minimal development effort (just MessagingUIExample + branding)
- Mobile publisher app unchanged (lower risk)
- Can pilot with subset of users
- Quick time to market (weeks instead of months)

**Cons:**
- **Poor user experience**: Two separate apps
- Confusing for users (which app to use?)
- Cannot access Experience Cloud content from messaging app
- Session continuity issues if users switch between apps
- Not a long-term solution

### Critical Limitations You Cannot Avoid

Since you don't have source code access to the mobile publisher app:

❌ **Cannot** add native SDK to existing mobile publisher app
❌ **Cannot** modify how the mobile publisher app handles networking
❌ **Cannot** integrate native session persistence into mobile publisher
❌ **Cannot** replace the embedded chat widget with native messaging in mobile publisher
❌ **Cannot** add custom native features to mobile publisher

✅ **Can only** build a completely new custom native app (Option 1)
✅ **Or** build a separate standalone messaging app (Option 2)

### Recommended Path Forward

Given your constraints (no source code, connectivity issues), here's the pragmatic recommendation:

#### Immediate Term: Proof of Concept (2-4 weeks)

1. **Evaluate the native SDK's effectiveness**
   - Open `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift` in Xcode
   - Replace the demo URL (line 69) with your Experience Cloud site URL
   - Configure with your Salesforce org credentials (configFile.json)
   - Run in simulator or on test device
   - Test with users experiencing connectivity issues:
     - Simulate network drops (Airplane mode on/off)
     - Force quit app and reopen - verify conversation persists
     - Measure: session persistence, reconnection behavior, user satisfaction
   - **Key validation**: Does the native SDK actually solve your connectivity problem?

2. **Calculate full replacement cost**
   - List all features in your current mobile publisher app
   - Compare with UIKitMIAW.swift capabilities
   - Identify gaps: push notifications, offline data, authentication, analytics, etc.
   - Estimate effort to achieve feature parity

#### Decision Point

After POC, you must decide:

**A. Full Replacement Justified?**
- If connectivity issues are severe and widespread
- If you have budget/team for custom native app development
- If you want long-term control over mobile experience
→ **Proceed with Option 1** (build custom native app)

**B. Not Worth Full Replacement?**
- If connectivity issues affect only small user segment
- If budget/resources are limited
- If mobile publisher app otherwise meets needs
→ **Consider alternatives**:
  - Deploy Option 2 (separate messaging app) as stopgap
  - Work with Salesforce to improve mobile publisher networking
  - Accept current limitations
  - Direct high-value users to native messaging app only

### Critical Questions for Salesforce

Before committing to either option, ask Salesforce:

1. **Is there a roadmap to improve mobile publisher networking/session handling?**
   - They may be planning fixes that solve your issue
   - Timeline for improvements?

2. **Can the mobile publisher app be customized with native plugins/extensions?**
   - Some mobile publisher frameworks allow native modules
   - Even if not currently supported, worth asking

3. **What's Salesforce's official recommendation for this scenario?**
   - They suggested native SDK - but did they understand you have no source code?
   - Do they have reference architectures for Experience Cloud + Native SDK?

4. **Can web chat and native SDK share conversation history?**
   - Critical for user experience if you run both
   - API for migrating conversations?

5. **What authentication method should we use?**
   - If building custom app: Passthrough auth with Salesforce Mobile SDK?
   - JWT-based user verification?
   - How to maintain user identity across web and native?

### If You Proceed with Option 1 (Custom Native App)

**Starting Point:** `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift` already provides the core architecture.

**What UIKitMIAW.swift Already Includes:**
- ✅ WKWebView for web content (lines 68-79)
- ✅ Native floating button overlay (lines 147-155)
- ✅ Native messaging interface (lines 162-196)
- ✅ Conversation persistence via ConversationManagementStore (line 54)
- ✅ Configuration management (lines 36-60)
- ✅ Delegate registration (line 62)

**What You Need to Add:**

1. **Replace demo URL with your Experience Cloud URL**
   - Current: `demoManagementStore.demoDomain` (line 69)
   - Change to: Your Experience Cloud site URL

2. **Hide web chat button in Experience Cloud**
   - Add JavaScript to detect mobile app
   - Use CSS to hide embedded messaging widget
   - Example: Check user agent or custom URL parameter

3. **Authentication integration**
   - Salesforce Mobile SDK (already imported in examples)
   - See: `examples/Shared/Enums/AuthorizationMethod.swift` - Passthrough option
   - Share auth state between web view and native messaging

4. **Push notifications**
   - Register for remote notifications
   - Handle notification payloads
   - Route to messaging conversation

5. **Additional mobile publisher features** (as needed)
   - Offline support
   - Analytics tracking
   - Custom navigation
   - App-specific settings

**Development Timeline (Revised with UIKitMIAW.swift):**
- Weeks 1-2: POC validation (use UIKitMIAW.swift as-is)
- Weeks 3-4: URL replacement, basic customization
- Weeks 5-8: Hide web chat, authentication integration
- Weeks 9-12: Push notifications, feature parity
- Weeks 13-15: Testing and refinement
- Weeks 16-17: App Store submission
- **Total: ~3-4 months** (faster because UIKitMIAW.swift exists)

### If You Proceed with Option 2 (Separate Messaging App)

**Deployment Strategy:**

1. Brand MessagingUIExample as "[YourCompany] Support Chat"
2. Deploy to App Store as standalone app
3. Notify users with connectivity issues
4. Provide clear instructions: "For chat support, download [YourCompany] Support Chat app"
5. Consider deprecating web chat for mobile users over time

**User Experience:**
- Two apps is awkward but may be acceptable as interim solution
- Clear communication about which app to use for what
- Eventually migrate all mobile users to separate messaging app
- Deprecate mobile publisher app when feasible

### Key Insight: UIKitMIAW.swift is Your Blueprint

The most important discovery is that **Salesforce already provides a working reference implementation** for the exact hybrid architecture you need:

**File:** `examples/MessagingUIExample/Views/UIKitMIAW.swift`

This file demonstrates:
- Loading web content (Experience Cloud) in WKWebView
- Overlaying a native chat button on top of web content
- Launching native messaging that persists across connectivity issues
- Managing conversation UUID for session continuity

**This is not a theoretical approach - it's working sample code you can adapt.**

Instead of building from scratch, you're adapting proven code that demonstrates the recommended pattern for combining web content with native messaging.

### Summary Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| **POC phase** | Run UIKitMIAW.swift with your Experience Cloud URL - validate it solves connectivity issues |
| **Connectivity issues are severe/widespread** | Option 1 - Build custom app starting from UIKitMIAW.swift |
| **Connectivity issues affect small subset** | Option 2 - Separate messaging app, or work with Salesforce on mobile publisher improvements |
| **Unclear if native SDK helps** | Start with POC before committing resources |
| **No iOS development resources** | Hire iOS developers or contract firm, starting point already exists (UIKitMIAW.swift) |

Q: When it comes to building a mobile app for Salesforce, I’m aware of the Salesforce Mobile SDK and have always understood that mobile apps are built using that SDK. However, when I look at the sample code provided here, I’m unclear whether it uses the Salesforce Mobile SDK, is built on top of the Mobile SDK, or represents a different or newer approach altogether.

Based on the source code provided, the `MessagingUIExample` app **does use the Salesforce Mobile SDK**, but it treats it as a complementary library rather than the sole foundation.

Here is the breakdown of how the sample code utilizes these SDKs:

### 1. It Uses Two Distinct SDKs
The sample application integrates two separate SDK packages that work side-by-side:

*   **Messaging for In-App SDK (`SMIClientUI`, `SMIClientCore`):** This is the newer, specialized SDK responsible for the "Advanced Messaging" features, chat feed UI, and the session persistence you are interested in.
*   **Salesforce Mobile SDK (`SalesforceSDKCore`, `MobileSync`, etc.):** This is the traditional SDK you are familiar with. The sample app includes it as a dependency to handle authentication and identity,.

### 2. Evidence of Salesforce Mobile SDK Usage
The `MessagingUIExample` is explicitly built with the Salesforce Mobile SDK included in its project dependencies.

*   **Project Dependencies:** The project file (`project.pbxproj`) lists `SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM` as a remote package dependency. It specifically links frameworks such as `SalesforceSDKCore`, `SalesforceSDKCommon`, and `SalesforceAnalytics`.
*   **Code Imports:** Several critical files in the sample code import `SalesforceSDKCore` alongside the messaging libraries. For example, `GlobalCoreDelegateHandler.swift` imports both `SMIClientCore` and `SalesforceSDKCore`.

### 3. How the Mobile SDK is Used in the Sample
In this specific sample app, the Salesforce Mobile SDK is used primarily for **User Verification (Authentication)**.

*   **Login Logic:** The app uses the Mobile SDK's `AuthHelper` to handle logging into Salesforce.
    *   *Source Evidence:* In `GlobalCoreDelegateHandler+UserVerification.swift`, the code calls `AuthHelper.loginIfRequired` to authenticate the user against your Salesforce Org.
*   **Token Retrieval:** It uses the Mobile SDK's `RestClient` to make authenticated API calls to fetch the JSON Web Tokens (JWT) required to verify the user's identity in the messaging session.
    *   *Source Evidence:* The function `fetchMIAWJWT` uses `RestClient.shared.send(request: request)` to retrieve the access token.
*   **Session Management:** The settings menu includes a button to logout using `UserAccountManager.shared.logout()`, which is a standard Salesforce Mobile SDK method.

### Summary for Your Implementation
You are not abandoning the Salesforce Mobile SDK approach. Instead, this sample demonstrates a **hybrid approach**:

1.  **Salesforce Mobile SDK:** Handles the "plumbing" of logging the user in and managing their Salesforce credentials.
2.  **Messaging for In-App SDK:** Handles the actual chat interface, message history, and the network resilience features you need to fix your connectivity issues.
